Roanoke
=======

A tasty treatise between English and American IPA's, this is our Roanoke's Lost Pale Ale recipe.

We used English style hops and English style grain but adjusted the recipe to have a very strong hoppy aroma and a astringent flaver akin to a American hophead.

Recipe

First-Fermentation
=======
=======
=======
* seven pounds of Muntons Amber Dried Malt Extract (color 18 EBC / Lovibond 7) (UK)
* one pound British crystal malt
* half'a pound malted barley, toasted 15 minutes at 350Â°F
* three ounces Northern Brewer hops, for boiling (13 HBU)
* two ounces Cascade hops, one finishing, one for flavering mid-boil
* two vials of liquid ale yeast (35mL each), White Labs London Ale Yeast (WLP013 (both from lot 1013Ttb7747601))

We're actually mid-brew, will update as we go, but we don't believe clarity (or a second fermentation) are in Roanoke's future.
